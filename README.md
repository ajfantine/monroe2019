This is the code for my headline generator and classifier that I made as part of my 2019 Monroe research project, 
"Countering Bias in Machine Learning Algorithms Through Natural Language Processing." It features three files:

<p>
Classifier, which contains code for the creation of a headline classifier model object that can be used in other programs.
Generator, which contains code for the creation of a headline generator model object that can be used in other programs.
headline-gan.py, which uses an instance of a Classifier and a Generator object to find the optimal diversity value for headline generation.
